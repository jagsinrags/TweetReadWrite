# TweetReadWrite
Write a console Java application to read Tweets and write them to different files in real-time.

STEPS:

 I used Java 9 to compile. To create file, you will need atleast Java 7 else it will error out.

STEP 1: Use command  `javac TweetReadWrite.java` to compile
STEP 2: To execute `java TweetReadWrite`
Once you will execute the program using java, I have explained everything on the console itself for help.

STEP 3: Enter 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 to choose different tweet options. At this stage enter any non-number and program will exit

STEP 4: Keep on enterting the tweets / text and press enter, it will either generate a new corresponding txt file or save the tween in the exisitng file

This program will automatically create 5 tweet files (in the same folder where this program is getting executed) as mentioned in the requirement document 
baseball.txt,
basketball.txt,
movies.txt,
books.txt, and
computers.txt

STEP 5: In the tweets sub menu, you can enter instead of a new tweet to move to the main menu and from there you can again follow from STEP 3

Press Ctl + c any time to exit out of the program
